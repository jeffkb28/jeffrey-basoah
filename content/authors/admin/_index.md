Jeffrey Basoah is a 2nd-year graduate student in the Department of Engineering Systems and Environment at the University of Virginia, pursuing a Master's in Systems Engineering. He received his Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech, with a minor in Green Engineering. His current research focuses on education equity by using sports analytics to increase the motivation of traditionally marginalized high school students to pursue STEM courses, degrees, and careers. Jeffrey has an enthusiasm for seeing the success of others and uplifting his community members to heights once thought unattainable. "Be the change you want to see" is a motto he lives by, and as a Co-Founder and Board Member of Acquiring Knowledge for Transcendence (AKT), the non-profit organization he created, he can put it into action. Through his non-profit, he is able to share knowledge on how to traverse the inner and external battles that come with elevating oneself above the expected.

After graduation, Jeffrey plans to enroll in a Ph.D. program where he conducts research that incorporates systems thinking and human-centered design to fully address the root of bias formation in technology. Jeffrey's focus will be on contributing to works and research that struggle with embodying fair human discernment in the design of AI systems. As the field currently struggles with modeling fair human decision-making, his studies will aim to highlight the stumbling blocks of this process to develop robust, ethical, and accountable systems. Jeffrey hopes to use this understanding to inform the development of a potential framework to mitigate the impacts of design inequities. He wants to examine how technologies are designed and created, the cultural assumptions and values that are embodied in them, and how they play a part in our lives. This will enable a more holistic data collection and analytics approach, concentrating on a more human-centric solution.
